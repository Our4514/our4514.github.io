We are the Pengcheng Zhang team of Hohai University. We now have 14 members (1 Ph.D., 13 masters). Our research interests are **service computing**, **smart contract bug detection**, **AI testing**, **service recommendation**, and **rainfall forecasting**.


## Existing work
Here, we list some existing works, part of which have open-source code.
